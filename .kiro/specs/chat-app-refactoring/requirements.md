# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for refactoring the existing Python chat application from a monolithic structure to a modular, security-first, production-ready codebase. The refactoring will maintain all existing functionality while improving code organization, security, documentation, type safety, and testing coverage.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modular Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase to be organized into logical modules and packages, so that the code is maintainable, testable, and follows separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the codebase is restructured THEN the system SHALL separate client and server functionality into distinct packages
2. WHEN organizing modules THEN the system SHALL create separate modules for networking, UI, message handling, user management, and service discovery
3. WHEN implementing the modular structure THEN the system SHALL use proper Python package structure with __init__.py files
4. WHEN refactoring THEN the system SHALL maintain clear interfaces between modules using abstract base classes or protocols
5. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate configuration, constants, and utilities into dedicated modules

### Requirement 2: Security Implementation

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the chat application to implement security best practices, so that the system is protected against common vulnerabilities and attacks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling user input THEN the system SHALL validate and sanitize all incoming data
2. WHEN processing messages THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting to prevent spam and DoS attacks
3. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL implement connection limits per IP address
4. WHEN handling network communication THEN the system SHALL implement proper error handling to prevent information leakage
5. WHEN storing or processing usernames THEN the system SHALL validate username format and length
6. WHEN broadcasting messages THEN the system SHALL prevent message injection attacks
7. WHEN handling network timeouts THEN the system SHALL implement secure timeout mechanisms

### Requirement 3: Type Safety and Documentation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive type hints and documentation throughout the codebase, so that the code is self-documenting and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing any function or method THEN the system SHALL include complete type hints for parameters and return values
2. WHEN creating classes THEN the system SHALL include type hints for all attributes
3. WHEN writing any function, method, or class THEN the system SHALL include Google-style docstrings
4. WHEN using complex types THEN the system SHALL use appropriate typing constructs (Union, Optional, Generic, etc.)
5. WHEN defining protocols or interfaces THEN the system SHALL use typing.Protocol for structural typing
6. WHEN the code is analyzed THEN the system SHALL pass mypy type checking without errors

### Requirement 4: Production-Ready Code Quality

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want the codebase to follow production-ready standards, so that it can be deployed and maintained in a production environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing code THEN the system SHALL follow PEP 8 style guidelines
2. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL implement comprehensive error handling with appropriate logging
3. WHEN managing resources THEN the system SHALL properly handle resource cleanup (sockets, threads, etc.)
4. WHEN configuring the application THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration
5. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL include proper logging with different log levels
6. WHEN packaging the application THEN the system SHALL include proper dependency management and requirements
7. WHEN deploying THEN the system SHALL support graceful shutdown mechanisms

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Testing Framework

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want comprehensive test coverage including unit tests, integration tests, and fuzzy testing, so that the application is reliable and robust.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing tests THEN the system SHALL create a dedicated tests/ directory structure
2. WHEN testing individual components THEN the system SHALL include unit tests for all modules with >90% code coverage
3. WHEN testing system integration THEN the system SHALL include integration tests for client-server communication
4. WHEN testing edge cases THEN the system SHALL include fuzzy testing for input validation and message handling
5. WHEN testing normal operations THEN the system SHALL include happy path tests for all user workflows
6. WHEN testing error conditions THEN the system SHALL include tests for all error handling scenarios
7. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL support automated test execution with pytest
8. WHEN testing network components THEN the system SHALL include mock testing for network operations
9. WHEN testing concurrent operations THEN the system SHALL include tests for thread safety and race conditions

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As an end user, I want the refactored application to maintain all existing functionality, so that I can continue using the chat application without any feature loss.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the client THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing UI features (scrolling, user list, message history)
2. WHEN connecting to servers THEN the system SHALL maintain service discovery functionality
3. WHEN chatting THEN the system SHALL support all existing commands (/nick, /quit)
4. WHEN running on Windows THEN the system SHALL maintain platform-specific keyboard input handling
5. WHEN broadcasting messages THEN the system SHALL maintain message formatting and delivery
6. WHEN managing users THEN the system SHALL maintain user list updates and notifications
7. WHEN handling connections THEN the system SHALL maintain multi-client support and message history

### Requirement 7: Performance and Scalability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the refactored application to maintain or improve performance characteristics, so that it can handle the expected load efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling multiple clients THEN the system SHALL maintain efficient thread management
2. WHEN processing messages THEN the system SHALL implement efficient message queuing and delivery
3. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL implement proper memory management for message history
4. WHEN handling network I/O THEN the system SHALL use efficient socket operations
5. WHEN updating the UI THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive user interface updates
6. WHEN scaling connections THEN the system SHALL support configurable connection limits
