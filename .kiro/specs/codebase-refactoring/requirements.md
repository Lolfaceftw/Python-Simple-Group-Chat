# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves refactoring and modularizing the existing Python Group Chat Application codebase to improve maintainability, testability, and code organization. The current codebase has monolithic files (client.py, server.py, main.py) that contain multiple responsibilities. The refactoring will reorganize the code into a clear modular structure following the established code standards while preserving all existing functionality and user interface behavior.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized into logical packages and modules, so that I can easily navigate, maintain, and extend the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the codebase SHALL be organized into `client/`, `server/`, `shared/`, `discovery/`, and `tools/` packages
2. WHEN examining the package structure THEN each package SHALL contain an `__init__.py` file with appropriate exports
3. WHEN looking at individual modules THEN each module SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
4. WHEN reviewing the code THEN all imports SHALL be updated to use the new modular structure

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all existing functionality preserved during refactoring, so that users experience no changes in application behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactored application is run THEN all server functionality SHALL work identically to the original
2. WHEN the refactored client is used THEN all UI features and interactions SHALL remain unchanged
3. WHEN testing the refactored code THEN all network protocols and message handling SHALL function exactly as before
4. WHEN running the application THEN service discovery, user management, and chat features SHALL operate without modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want shared components extracted into a common package, so that code duplication is eliminated and consistency is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the shared package THEN it SHALL contain common constants, exceptions, protocols, and utility functions
2. WHEN reviewing client and server code THEN they SHALL import shared components instead of duplicating code
3. WHEN looking at configuration handling THEN it SHALL be centralized in the shared package
4. WHEN checking logging and metrics THEN they SHALL be implemented as shared utilities

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the entry points (main.py, server.py, client.py) to be thin wrappers, so that the core logic is properly encapsulated in modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the root-level files THEN they SHALL contain minimal code focused only on application startup
2. WHEN reviewing main.py THEN it SHALL primarily handle argument parsing and delegate to client modules
3. WHEN looking at server.py THEN it SHALL focus on server initialization and delegate to server modules
4. WHEN checking client.py THEN it SHALL be refactored into the client package with appropriate entry points

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper separation of concerns between networking, UI, and business logic, so that each component can be tested and modified independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the client package THEN networking code SHALL be separated from UI components
2. WHEN reviewing the server package THEN message handling SHALL be separated from connection management
3. WHEN looking at the discovery functionality THEN it SHALL be extracted into its own dedicated package
4. WHEN checking business logic THEN it SHALL be separated from presentation and networking layers

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all modules to follow the established code standards, so that the codebase maintains consistency and quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing any module THEN it SHALL have complete Google-style docstrings for all functions and classes
2. WHEN examining function signatures THEN they SHALL have complete type hints using the typing module
3. WHEN looking at class definitions THEN they SHALL follow protocol-based interfaces where appropriate
4. WHEN checking error handling THEN it SHALL use custom exceptions from the shared package
5. WHEN reviewing resource management THEN it SHALL use context managers and proper cleanup patterns
